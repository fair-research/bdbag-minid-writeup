abstract ={High-throughput data production technologies, particularly ‘next-generation’ DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.},

	abstract = {Modern biomedical data collection is generating exponentially more data in a multitude of formats. This flood of complex data poses significant opportunities to discover and understand the critical interplay among such diverse domains as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, including imaging, biometrics, and clinical data. The Big Data for Discovery Science Center is taking an {\textquotedblleft}-ome to home{\textquotedblright} approach to discover linkages between these disparate data sources by mining existing databases of proteomic and genomic data, brain images, and clinical assessments. In support of this work, the authors developed new technological capabilities that make it easy for researchers to manage, aggregate, manipulate, integrate, and model large amounts of distributed data. Guided by biological domain expertise, the Center{\textquoteright}s computational resources and software will reveal relationships and patterns, aiding researchers in identifying biomarkers for the most confounding conditions and diseases, such as Parkinson{\textquoteright}s and Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s.},

	title = {Uniform Resolution of Compact Identifiers for Biomedical Data},
	year = {2018},
	doi = {10.1101/101279},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Compact identifiers have been widely used in biomedical informatics both formally and informally. They consist of two parts: 1) a unique prefix or namespace indicating the assigning authority and 2) a locally assigned database identifier sometimes called an accession number. The former is used to avoid global identifier collisions when integrating separately managed datasets that are run by different communities and consortia under a variety of autonomous data management systems and practices. This bi-partite identifier approach predates the invention of the Web, but can be leveraged to work more harmoniously with it. Identifiers.org and N2T.net are two meta-resolvers that take any given identifier from over 500 source databases and reliably redirect it to its original source on the Web. Identifiers.org is based at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and serves the biomedical domain; whereas N2T.net (Name-to-Thing) is based at the California Digital Library (CDL), University of California Office of the President, and is domain-agnostic. Both resolvers, while derived from independently developed code bases, with different features and objectives, can now uniformly resolve compact identifiers using a set of common procedures and redirection rules. Here we report on significant further work by our teams toward a more unified approach to making compact identifiers available for long-term use in an ecosystem supporting formal citation of primary scholarly research data. This approach is intended to be robust beyond the operational and funding scope of any one organization, enabling long-term resolution of persistent archived data, whether it is cited in the literature, or is referenced in the web at large. We demonstrate that multiple resolvers with fundamentally different underlying code bases, organizational settings and international alignments, can readily support this approach. As part of this project we have deployed public, production-quality resolvers using a common registry of prefix-based redirection rules. We believe these products and our approach will be of significant help to publishers, authors and others implementing persistent, machine-resolvable citation of research data in compliance with emerging science policy recommendations and funder requirements.},
